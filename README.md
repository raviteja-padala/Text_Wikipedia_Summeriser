# Text_Wikipedia_Summeriser

## **`Project Name:`** Text_Wikipedia_Summeriser

## **`Project Description:`** This project involves creating a Streamlit web application that allows users to summarize text using the txtai library. It provides two main functionalities: summarizing user-provided text and summarizing Wikipedia articles based on user search queries.

## **`Problem Statement:`** Users often need to extract key information or generate concise summaries from large text documents, which can be a time-consuming and challenging task. This project aims to address this problem by providing a user-friendly interface for text summarization.

## **`Business Need:`** The business need for this project is to provide a tool that can help businesses save time and money. By automating the process of summarizing text, businesses can save time and resources that can be used for other tasks.

## **`Project Objectives:`**
1. Create a user interface with Streamlit for text summarization.
2. Implement text summarization using the txtai library.
3. Allow users to input their own text for summarization.
4. Enable users to search and summarize Wikipedia articles.

## **`Deliverables:`**
1. Streamlit web application for text summarization.
2. Text summarization functionality using txtai.
3. User interface for inputting text and summarizing it.
4. Wikipedia article search and summarization feature.

## **`Scope:`** The project's scope includes developing a functional Streamlit web application with text summarization capabilities. It covers both user-provided text and Wikipedia article summarization. However, it does not include more advanced features like user authentication, user profiles, or advanced natural language processing techniques beyond text summarization.

## **`Assumptions and Limitations:`**
- Assumes access to the internet to retrieve Wikipedia articles.
- Limited to summarizing Wikipedia articles that are publicly available.
- The text summarization model used (txtai) has its own limitations and may not work optimally for all types of text.
- Assumes basic input validation for user-provided text.
- Assumes that the txtai library and its dependencies are properly installed.

## **`Future Enhancements:`** Potential future enhancements for this project could include:
1. Improved text summarization models or methods.
2. Customization options for summarization length.
3. Integration with external data sources beyond Wikipedia.
4. Support for summarizing documents in multiple languages.
5. Enhanced error handling and user feedback.

## **`Conclusion:`** This project aims to simplify text summarization tasks for users by providing a user-friendly web interface that leverages the txtai library. It offers both the ability to summarize user-provided text and to search and summarize Wikipedia articles. While it addresses the basic needs of text summarization, there is room for future enhancements and improvements to make it more robust and versatile.
